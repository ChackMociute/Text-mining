    "This notebook describes the LAB-2 assignment of the Text Mining course. It is about sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of the assignment are:\n",
    "* Learn how to run a rule-based sentiment analysis module (VADER)\n",
    "* Learn how to run a machine learning sentiment analysis module (Scikit-Learn/ Naive Bayes)\n",
    "* Learn how to run scikit-learn metrics for the quantitative evaluation\n",
    "* Learn how to perform and interpret a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes of the tools (in terms of Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>)\n",
    "* Learn how to evaluate the results qualitatively (by examining the data) \n",
    "* Get insight into differences between the two applied methods\n",
    "* Get insight into the effects of using linguistic preprocessing\n",
    "* Be able to describe differences between the two methods in terms of their results\n",
    "* Get insight into issues when applying these methods across different  domains\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to create your own gold standard set from 50 tweets. You will the VADER and scikit-learn classifiers to these tweets and evaluate the results by using evaluation metrics and inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you go through the notebooks in the following order:\n",
    "* **Read the assignment (see below)**\n",
    "* **Lab3.2-Sentiment-analysis-with-VADER.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Lab3.3-Sentiment-analysis.with-scikit-learn.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Answer the questions of the assignment (see below) using the provided notebooks and submit**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are asked to perform both quantitative evaluations and error analyses:\n",
    "* a quantitative evaluation concerns the scores (Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>) provided by scikit's classification_report. It includes the scores per category, as well as micro and macro averages. Discuss whether the scores are balanced or not between the different categories (positive, negative, neutral) and between precision and recall. Discuss the shortcomings (if any) of the classifier based on these scores\n",
    "* an error analysis regarding the misclassifications of the classifier. It involves going through the texts and trying to understand what has gone wrong. It servers to get insight in what could be done to improve the performance of the classifier. Do you observe patterns in misclassifications?  Discuss why these errors are made and propose ways to solve them."

    "#### NEUTRAL LABELS:\n",
    "*The neutral tweets that were labeled incorrectly by VADER, generally seem to do so as a result of having positive or negative words in the sentence, that do not necessarily contribute to the sentiment. Examples of the positive words can be seen in tweets 4, 10 and 26, with words such as 'favorate' and 'justice'. The only tweet labeled as negative (tweet 26) contains negative words such as 'forced' and 'cut'.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### POSITIVE LABELS:\n",
    "*All misclasifications for the tweets that should have been marked as positive, are because VADER marked them as neutral instead. Most of these tweets state something positive, despite something negative (2, 6, 35, 37). These generally contain a mix of positive and negative words, which makes it understandable that it was classified as neutral. More complex reasoning is required to understand the true meaning/sentement of such statements. Additionally, one of the tweets contained a metaphorical statement (17), which is also inherently difficult to classify correctly.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NEGATIVE LABELS:\n",
    "*Many of the negative tweets, VADER has labeled as positive instead. This is partially due to people using positive (or strengthening) words to describe negative things, to emphasise how bad it is (0, 3, 20, 21, 22, 30, 31). In some cases, it is even done sarcastically (9). Some tweets that VADER marked as neutral contain a more cryptic negative sentement, and does not contain (many strong) negative or positive words (5, 22).*"
